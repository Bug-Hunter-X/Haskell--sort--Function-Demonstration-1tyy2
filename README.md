# Haskell Sort Function Demonstration

This repository contains a simple Haskell program that demonstrates the use of the `sort` function from the `Data.List` module. The program shows how `sort` works with different types of lists, including empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists containing negative numbers.

The code is designed to be clear, concise, and easy to understand. It's intended as a basic example for those learning Haskell or who want to see how the `sort` function behaves in practice.  There are no bugs or issues present; it serves purely as an illustrative example.

## Usage

1.  Save the code as `sortBug.hs`.
2.  Compile and run using a Haskell compiler (like GHC): `ghc sortBug.hs && ./sortBug`

The output will show the sorted versions of each input list.
